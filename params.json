{"name":"Nolan","body":"# Nolan CellType for ExpressionEngine 2.0 Matrix Field\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nNolan enables a very simple matrix style field within a [Pixel & Tonic Matrix](http://pixelandtonic.com/matrix) field\r\n\r\n![Field Output](http://iain.co.nz/dev/nolan_field2.png)\r\n\r\n### Installing/Usage\r\nInstall the Nolan Fieldtype and you'll see 'Nolan' as an available celltype when configuring Matrix.\r\n\r\nTwo required configuration fields are Column Labels and Column Names.\r\n\r\n'Column Labels' are what your publishers see, and 'Column Names' are what you reference in templates.\r\n\r\nFor example, I maybe have a Nolan cell with a short name of 'players', and I want it to contain first and last names of team players along with their position in the game.\r\n\r\nIn Column Labels, I'd enter: **First Name | Last Name | Position** <br />\r\nIn Column Names, I'd enter: **first_name | last_name | position**\r\n\r\n![Configuration](http://iain.co.nz/dev/nolan_config.png)\r\n\r\nThen if my matrix field had the short name 'teams', I could access the Nolan fields like so:\r\n\r\n\t{teams} <!-- matrix field -->\r\n\t\t{players}<!-- nolan cell -->\r\n\t\t\t{first_name}, {last_name} - {position}\r\n\t\t{/players}\r\n\t{/teams}\r\n\r\nAdditional variables available are:\r\n\r\n\t{total_nolan_cols} - Number of columns in the Nolan cell\r\n\t{total_nolan_rows} - Number of rows in the Nolan cell\r\n\t{nolan_row_count} - Same as {count} to avoid variable clashes\r\n\r\n\r\n### Caveats\r\nChanging a Nolan cells short name will **not** update existing values set, so choose your short names wisely.\r\n\r\n### Support and Feature Requests\r\nThis celltype was developed for a specific task and has been 'generalised' for GitHub. I haven't done a whole lot of testing so be aware if you're using in a production environment.\r\n\r\nThe add-on is not officially supported but send requests/bug reports/pull requests here to this repo - NOT to devot:ee as I won't get notified. \r\n\r\n### Hat tip\r\n\r\nHat tip to Stephen Lewis [@monooso](http://twitter.com/monooso) of Experience Internet for [Roland.js](https://github.com/experience/jquery.roland.js) which I modified with permission for Nolan.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2012 Iain Urquhart\r\nhttp://iain.co.nz","tagline":"Kinda like inception, but for Matrix.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
